      <h4 class="checkpoint">Checkpoints (20 points)</h4>
      <ol>
        <li id="checkpoint1">
          <i>Find hard object images</i> (5 points):<br/>
          Find an assortment of high resolution photos of different objects. The photos should be taken from a side view so that you are able to accurately measure the proportions of the object's features (try product photographs in ecommerce sites). Your object will be comprised of simple polygonal volumes that have been combined and grouped to create the final model.<br/>

          <i>Find soft object images</i> (5 points):<br/>
          Find an assortment of high resolution photos of different objects. The photos should be taken from a side view so that you are able to accurately measure the proportions of the object's features (try product photographs in ecommerce sites). Your bject will be comprised of polygonal or NURBS meshes that have been sculpted to create the final model.<br/>
          <br/>
        </li>
        <li id="checkpoint3">
          <i>Idea illustrations</i> (5 points):<br/>
          Draw some ideas for what your product will be, how it will appear, what shape it will take, and what qualities you want it to evoke.<br/>
          <br/>
        </li>

      <h4 class="project">Projects (80 points)</h4>
      <ol>
        <li id="project1">
          <i>Hard-surface Model</i> (15 points):<br/>
          Craft a specific type of object using only the simple polygonal modeling tools provided in Maya. Using boolean combinations to add or subtract areas of the model as well as grouping pieces together. Produce a basic rendering at 1920 x 1080. Submit your Maya scene as well as the rendering.<br/><br/>
        </li>
        <li id="project2">
          <i>Organic Model</i> (15 points):<br/>
          Craft a specific type of object using the soft modeling tools provided in Maya such as meshes and NURBS. The object should have smooth qualities, taking advantage of the mesh tools. Produce a basic rendering at 1920 x 1080. Submit your Maya scene as well as the rendering.<br/><br/>
        </li>
        <li id="project3">
          <i>Model Rendering</i> (25 points):<br/>
          Invent a new product. It can be fictional or an improved version of something that currently exists. Apply materials and lighting to your object to make it as photo realistic as possible. Play with textures, coloring, and the effect of lighting on the various types of materials. Use Adobe Photoshop to create or modify materials for use on your models.  Set up a number of cameras in your scene in order to render multiple vantage points. Use the Arnold renderer and render your images at 3840 x 2160.<br/><br/>
        </li>
        <li id="project4">
          <i>Printed Model</i> (30 points):<br/>
          Take the model you created in the previous assignment and prepare it for 3D printing. Ensure that it is a water-tight mesh and the model has been appropriately smoothed. Export the model and reproduce it physically using one of the Makerbot machines in the Garage.<br/><br/>
